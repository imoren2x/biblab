Type Casting
------------
Link: http://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/typecasting/

Implicit conversion
	Example:
		short a = 2000;
		int b;
		b = a;

Explicit conversion
	C++ is a strong-type language.
	Two notations for explicit conversion:
		 functional
		 c-like
	Example:
		short a = 2000;
		int b;
		b = (int) a; 	//c-like cast notation//
		b = int(a);		//functional/object notation//

	Beware of syntactically correct code, but causes runtime errors.
	Example:
		// class type-casting
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;

		class CDummy
		{
			float i,j;
		};

		class CAddition
		{
			int x,y;
		  public:
			CAddition (int a, int b) { x=a; y=b; }
			int result() { return x+y;}
		};

		int main ()
		{
		  CDummy d;
		  CAddition * padd;
		  //Incopatible-type pointing//
		  //Result: run-time error or unexpected result//
		  padd = (CAddition*) &d;
		  cout << padd->result();
		  return 0;
		}

	There are four specific casting operators:
		 dynamic_cast
		 reinterpret_cast
		 static_cast
		 const_cast
	Syntax:
		dynamic_cast <new_type> (expression)
		reinterpret_cast <new_type> (expression)
		static_cast <new_type> (expression)
		const_cast <new_type> (expression)
	Old syntax:
		(new_type) expression
		new_type (expression)

Dynamic cast
	Used only with pointers and references to objects.
	Example:
		class CBase { };
		class CDerived: public CBase { };

		CBase b; CBase* pb;
		CDerived d; CDerived* pd;

		pb = dynamic_cast<CBase*>(&d);     // ok: derived-to-base
		pd = dynamic_cast<CDerived*>(&b);  // wrong: base-to-derived
										   // if polymorphic class, not wrong, ok

		// dynamic_cast
		#include <iostream>
		#include <exception>
		using namespace std;

		class CBase { virtual void dummy() {} };
		class CDerived: public CBase { int a; };

		int main () {
		  try {
			CBase * pba = new CDerived;
			CBase * pbb = new CBase;
			CDerived * pd;

			pd = dynamic_cast<CDerived*>(pba);
			if (pd==0) cout << "Null pointer on first type-cast" << endl;

			pd = dynamic_cast<CDerived*>(pbb);
			if (pd==0) cout << "Null pointer on second type-cast" << endl;

		  } catch (exception& e) {cout << "Exception: " << e.what();}
		  return 0;
		}
	Result:
		Null pointer on second type-cast

	Compatibility note:
		dynamic_cast requires RTTI (Run-Time Type Information)

Static Cast
	For conversion between pointers to related classes, base to derived, derived to base.
	Example:
		class CBase {};
		class CDerived: public CBase {};
		CBase * a = new CBase;
		CDerived * b = static_cast<CDerived*>(a);
	This would be valid, although b would point to an incomplete object of the class and could lead to runtime errors if dereferenced.
	It's up to the programmer to ensure that the conversion is safe.

	Also, for any other non-pointer conversion that could also be performed implicitly:
		double d=3.14159265;
		int i = static_cast<int>(d);

Reinterpret cast
	Converts any pointer type to any other pointer type, even of unrelated classes.
		class A {};
		class B {};
		A * a = new A;
		B * b = reinterpret_cast<B*>(a);

Const cast
	This type of casting manipulates the constness of an object, either to be set or to be removed. For example, in order to pass a const argument to a function that expects a non-constant parameter:
	Example:
		// const_cast
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;

		void print (char * str)
		{
		  cout << str << endl;
		}

		int main () {
		  const char * c = "sample text";
		  print ( const_cast<char *> (c) );
		  return 0;
		}

Typeid
	Typeid allows to check the type of an expression:
		typeid (expression)
	Comparation operators:
		 ==
		 !=
		 null-terminated character sequence representing the data type or class name by using its name() member.
	Example:
		// typeid
		#include <iostream>
		#include <typeinfo>
		using namespace std;

		int main () {
		  int * a,b;
		  a=0; b=0;
		  if (typeid(a) != typeid(b))
		  {
			cout << "a and b are of different types:\n";
			cout << "a is: " << typeid(a).name() << '\n';
			cout << "b is: " << typeid(b).name() << '\n';
		  }
		  return 0;
		}

	In classes, typeid uses the RTTI to keep track of the type of dynamic objects.
	In expressions whose type is a polymorphic classes, the result is the type of the most derived complete object.
	Example:
		// typeid, polymorphic class
		#include <iostream>
		#include <typeinfo>
		#include <exception>
		using namespace std;

		class CBase { virtual void f(){} };
		class CDerived : public CBase {};

		int main ()
		{
		  try {
			CBase* a = new CBase;
			CBase* b = new CDerived;
			cout << "a is: " << typeid(a).name() << '\n';
			cout << "b is: " << typeid(b).name() << '\n';
			cout << "*a is: " << typeid(*a).name() << '\n';
			cout << "*b is: " << typeid(*b).name() << '\n';
		  } catch (exception& e) { cout << "Exception: " << e.what() << endl; }
		  return 0;
		}

	Result:
		a is: class CBase *
		b is: class CBase *
		*a is: class CBase
		*b is: class CDerived

	Exceptions:
		If the type typeid evaluates is a pointer preceded by the dereference operator (*), and this pointer has a null value, typeid throws a bad_typeid exception.

	Pointer type/Object type:
		 pointer type (a and b are of type class CBase *)
		 object type (*a and *b), returns their dynamic type.
