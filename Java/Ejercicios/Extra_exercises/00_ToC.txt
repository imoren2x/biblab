• Interest.java, from Section 2.2, computes the interest on a specific amount of money over a period of one year.

• TimedComputation.java, from Section 2.3, demonstrates a few basic built-in subroutines
and functions.
• EnumDemo.java, from Section 2.3, a very simple first demonstration of enum types.
• PrintSquare.java, from Section 2.4, reads an integer typed in by the user and prints the
square of that integer. This program depends on TextIO.java. The same is true
for almost all of the programs in the rest of this list.
• Interest2.java, from Section 2.4, calculates interest on an investment for one year, based
on user input.
• CreateProfile.java, from Section 2.4, a simple demo of output to a file, using TextIO.
• Interest2WithScanner.java, from Section 2.4, is a version of Interest2.java that uses Scanner
instead of TextIO to read input from the user.
• Interest3.java, from Section 3.1, the first example that uses control statements.
• ThreeN1.java, from Section 3.2, outputs a 3N+1 sequence for a given stating value.
• ComputeAverage.java, from Section 3.3, computes the average value of some integers
entered by the user.
• CountDivisors.java, from Section 3.4, counts the number of divisors of an integer entered
by the user.
• ListLetters.java, from Section 3.4, lists all the distinct letters in a string entered by the
user.
• LengthConverter.java, from Section 3.5, converts length measurements input by the user
into different units of measure.
• ReadNumbersFromFile.java, from Section 3.7, finds the sum and the average of numbers
read from a file. Demonstrates try..catch statements.
• GuessingGame.java, from Section 4.2, lets the user play guessing games where the com-
puter picks a number and the user tries to guess it. A slight variation of this program,
which reports the number of games won by the user, is GuessingGame2.java.
