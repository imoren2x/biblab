1.x Special variables

    argc                Refers to a number of command-line arguments.
    argv                Refers to the list containing the command-line arguments.
    argv0               Refers to the file name of the file being interpreted or the name by which we invoke the script.
    env                 Used for representing the array of elements that are environmental variables.
    errorCode           Provides the error code for last Tcl error.
    errorInfo           Provides the stack trace for last Tcl error.
    tcl_interactive     Used for setting the location of standard Tcl libraries.
    tcl_pkgPath         Provides the list of directories where packages are generally installed.
    tcl_patchLevel      Refers to the current patch level of the Tcl interpreter.
    tcl_platform        Used for representing the array of elements with objects including byteOrder, machine, osVersion, platform, and os.
    tcl_precision       Refers to the precision i.e. number of digits to retain when converting to floating-point numbers to strings. The default value is 12.
    tcl_prompt1         Refers to the primary prompt.
    tcl_prompt2         Refers to the secondary prompt with invalid commands.
    tcl_rcFileName      Provides the user specific startup file.
    tcl_traceCompile    Used for controlling the tracing of bytecode compilation. Use 0 for no output, 1 for summary, and 2 for detailed.
    tcl_traceExec       Used for controlling the tracing of bytecode execution. Use 0 for no output, 1 for summary, and 2 for detailed.
    tcl_version         Returns the current version of the Tcl interpreter.
