Use-case diagrams (UML)
-----------------------
Behavioral diagram

Basic approach: it expresses the functionality provided by a system (actors, goals (use cases) and dependencies).

Shows what system functions are performed for which actor

----------------------------------

1. Diagram building blocks

	1. Use case:
		Sequence of actions that provide something of measurement value.
		(circle with use case)
	
	2. Actors:
		Person/organization/system which plays a role in one or more interactions.
		(actor character)
	
	3. System boundary boxes (optional)
		Scope of the system.
		Within the box represents functionality.

2. Use case relationships
	2.1 Include 
	2.2 Extend
	2.3 Generalization
	2.4 Association

2.1 Include
One use case includes another use case.

						<<include>>
	including use-case -------------> included use-case

2.2 Extend
The extension use case may be inserted in the extended use case under some conditions.

						<<extend>>
	extension use-case -------------> extended use-case
						{if ... }


	Usually, extend eq 'optional'
					eq 'potentially not executed with the base use case.
					eq not required to achieve the base use case goal.

2.3 Generalization/specialization

	General <_____________ Specific

2.4 Associations
	A __________________ B

2.5 Uses

				<<use>>
	using use-case -------------> use case used
