Input/output with files
-----------------------

C++ provides the following classes to perform output and input of characters to/from files:
	 ofstream: Stream class to write on files
	 ifstream: Stream class to read from files
	 fstream: Stream class to both read and write from/to files.

Example:
	// basic file operations
    #include <iostream>
    #include <fstream>
    using namespace std;

    int main () {
      ofstream myfile;
      myfile.open ("example.txt");
      myfile << "Writing this to a file.\n";
      myfile.close();
      return 0;
    }

1 Open a file
Example:
    fstream myfile;
    myfile.open ("example.bin", ios::out | ios::app | ios::binary);

.open(filename, mode);
    ios::in		Open for input operations.
    ios::out	Open for output operations.
    ios::binary	Open in binary mode.
    ios::ate	Set the initial position at the end of the file.
                If this flag is not set to any value, the initial position is the beginning of the file.
    ios::app	All output operations are performed at the end of the file, appending the content to the current content of the file.
                This flag can only be used in streams open for output-only operations.
    ios::trunc	If the file opened for output operations already existed before, its previous content is deleted and replaced by the new one.

Check a file open:
    if (myfile.is_open()) { /* ok, proceed with output */ }

2 Closing a file
	myfile.close();

3 Text files
	Data output:
		// writing on a text file
		#include <iostream>
		#include <fstream>
		using namespace std;

		int main () {
		  ofstream myfile ("example.txt");			| [file example.txt]
		  if (myfile.is_open())						| This is a line.
		  {											| This is another line.
			myfile << "This is a line.\n";
			myfile << "This is another line.\n";
			myfile.close();
		  }
		  else cout << "Unable to open file";
		  return 0;
		}

	Data input:
		// reading a text file
		#include <iostream>
		#include <fstream>
		#include <string>
		using namespace std;

		int main () {							| This is a line.
		  string line;							| This is another line.
		  ifstream myfile ("example.txt");		|
		  if (myfile.is_open())
		  {
			while ( myfile.good() )
			{
			  getline (myfile,line);
			  cout << line << endl;
			}
			myfile.close();
		  }

		  else cout << "Unable to open file";

		  return 0;
		}
	.good(): that returns true in the case that the stream is ready for input/output operations.

Checking state flags
	bad()
		Returns true if a reading or writing operation fails. For example in the case that we try to write to a file that is not open for writing or if the device where we try to write has no space left.
	fail()
		Returns true in the same cases as bad(), but also in the case that a format error happens, like when an alphabetical character is extracted when we are trying to read an integer number.
	eof()
		Returns true if a file open for reading has reached the end.
	good()
		It is the most generic state flag: it returns false in the same cases in which calling any of the previous functions would return true.
	clear()
		Resets all flags.

get and put stream pointers
	pos_type tellg() and tellp()
		Returns the current position of get stream pointer (tellg) or put stream pointer (tellp).
	seekg() and seekp()
		seekg ( post_type position );
		seekp ( post_type position );

	seekg ( off_type offset, seekdir direction );
	seekp ( off_type offset, seekdir direction );

	seekdir = type(enum):
		ios::beg	offset counted from the beginning of the stream
		ios::cur	offset counted from the current position of the stream pointer
		ios::end	offset counted from the end of the stream

	// obtaining file size
	#include <iostream>
	#include <fstream>
	using namespace std;

	int main ()
	{
	  long begin,end;
	  ifstream myfile ("example.txt");
	  begin = myfile.tellg();
	  myfile.seekg (0, ios::end);
	  end = myfile.tellg();
	  myfile.close();
	  cout << "size is: " << (end-begin) << " bytes.\n";
	  return 0;
	}

Binary files
	Methods to access:
		.write ( memory_block, size );
		.read ( memory_block, size );

	Example:
		// reading a complete binary file
		#include <iostream>
		#include <fstream>
		using namespace std;

		ifstream::pos_type size;
		char * memblock;

		int main () {
		  ifstream file ("example.bin", ios::in|ios::binary|ios::ate);
		  if (file.is_open())
		  {
			size = file.tellg();
			memblock = new char [size];
			file.seekg (0, ios::beg);
			file.read (memblock, size);
			file.close();

			cout << "the complete file content is in memory";

			delete[] memblock;
		  }
		  else cout << "Unable to open file";
		  return 0;
		}

Buffers and Synchronization
	When the buffer is flushed, all the data contained in it is written to the physical medium (if it is an output stream) or simply freed (if it is an input stream).
	This process is called synchronization and takes place under any of the following circumstances:
		 When the file is closed:
			before closing a file all buffers that have not yet been flushed are synchronized and all pending data is written or read to the physical medium.
		 When the buffer is full:
			Buffers have a certain size. When the buffer is full it is automatically synchronized.
		 Explicitly, with manipulators:
			When certain manipulators are used on streams, an explicit synchronization takes place. These manipulators are: flush and endl.
		 Explicitly, with member function sync():
			Calling stream's member function sync(), which takes no parameters, causes an immediate synchronization. This function returns an int value equal to -1 if the stream has no associated buffer or in case of failure. Otherwise (if the stream buffer was successfully synchronized) it returns 0.
