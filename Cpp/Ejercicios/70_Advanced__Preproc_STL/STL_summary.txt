Arrays are fixed-size sequence containers: they hold a specific number of elements ordered in a strict linear sequence.

Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

Lists are sequence containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence, and iteration in both directions.
